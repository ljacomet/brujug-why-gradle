== Incremental compilation

=== Basics

[%step]
* Given a set of source files
* Only compile the files which have changed...
* and their dependencies
* Language specific

=== In practice

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.commons.math3.complex.Complex;

public class Library {
    public Complex someLibraryMethod() {
        return Complex.I;
    }
}
----

[%step]
* `Complex` is a dependency of `Library`
* if `Complex` is changed, we need to recompile `Library`
* if `ComplexUtils` is changed, no need to recompile

=== Gotcha

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.commons.math3.dfp.Dfp;

public class LibraryUtils {
   public static int getMaxExp() {
      return Dfp.MAX_EXP;
   }
}
----

[%step]
* `Dfp` is a dependency of `LibraryUtils`
* so if `MAX_EXP` changes, we should recompile `LibraryUtils`, right?

=== Wait a minute...

> `javap -v build/classes/java/main/LibraryUtils.class`

```
...
  public static int getMaxExp();
    descriptor: ()I
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC
    Code:
      stack=1, locals=0, args_size=0
         0: ldc           #3                  // int 32768
         2: ireturn
```

[%step]
* reference to `Dfp` is gone!
* compiler _inlines_ some constants
* JLS says compiler doesn't have to add the dependent class to constant pool

=== What Gradle does

[%step]
* Analyze all _bytecode_ of all classes
* Record which constants are used in which file
* Whenever a producer changes, check if a _constant_ changed
* If yes, recompile _everything_
